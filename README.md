### Synopsis 
My undergraduate thesis analyzed the benefits to chemical engineering optimization that can be made using Deepmind's JAX library. We used the carbon dioxide to methanol process as an example problem. 

### Directory Structure
The project is documentated in `Report.pdf`. The reactor, separator and overall process model can be found in `models.py`. This is the main code of the project. Model validation can be found in `model_validation.py` and the comparison of optimization methods can be found in `compare_optimisation_methods.py'. Stream tables, at base case conditions and found optimal conditions, can be found under `data`. Whilst various plots can be found under `images`.
